### 6.0.1 (2025-05-04)

### 6.0.0 (2025-04-30)

Great care has been taken to make sure that this new version -- despite the numerous changes and
improvements -- is fully backwards compatible with prior versions, i. e. all questions created
in earlier versions will still work. Note, however, that questions including the new features
listed below can no longer be imported to Moodle systems using a 5.x.x version of the Formulas
question plugin.

We have done extensive testing. However, we recommend you not to update the plugin while you have
pending attempts at important exams.
